> Provides improved asymptotic formulas for partition functions with refined error terms and establishes new bounds for restricted partition functions, with applications to statistical physics.

## Abstract

We present new results on the asymptotic behavior of partition functions, extending classical work by Hardy-Ramanujan and Rademacher. Our main contribution is a refined error term in the asymptotic expansion of the partition function p(n) and new bounds for restricted partition functions. We develop novel techniques combining complex analysis and modular forms to achieve these improvements. Applications to statistical physics and combinatorial enumeration are discussed.

## Key Contributions

1. Refined error term in Hardy-Ramanujan-Rademacher expansion with O(n^(-3/4)) bound
2. New asymptotic formula for k-restricted partition functions with O(1/n) error term
3. Uniform bounds for restricted partition functions with exponential growth rate
