\section{Applications}

Our results have several applications in statistical physics and combinatorial enumeration.

\subsection{Statistical Physics}

The partition function asymptotics directly apply to the microcanonical ensemble in statistical mechanics. For a system with energy levels $\{1,2,3,\ldots\}$, the density of states $\Omega(E)$ is given by $\partition{E}$.

\begin{corollary}
The entropy $S(E)$ of such a system satisfies
\[ S(E) = \ln \Omega(E) = \pi\sqrt{\frac{2E}{3}} + \bigO(\ln E) \]
\end{corollary}

\subsection{Combinatorial Applications}

The uniform bounds in Theorem 3 provide new estimates for various combinatorial problems, including:
\begin{itemize}
\item Counting compositions with restricted part sizes
\item Estimating the number of integer points in certain polytopes
\item Analyzing random partition processes
\end{itemize}
