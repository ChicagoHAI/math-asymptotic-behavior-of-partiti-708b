We present new results on the asymptotic behavior of partition functions, extending classical work by Hardy-Ramanujan and Rademacher. Our main contribution is a refined error term in the asymptotic expansion of the partition function $\partition{n}$ and new bounds for restricted partition functions. We develop novel techniques combining complex analysis and modular forms to achieve these improvements. Applications to statistical physics and combinatorial enumeration are discussed.
