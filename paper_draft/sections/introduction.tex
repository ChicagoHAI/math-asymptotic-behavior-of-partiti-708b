\section{Introduction}

The partition function $\partition{n}$, which counts the number of ways to write a positive integer $n$ as a sum of positive integers, has been a central object of study in number theory for over a century. The groundbreaking work of Hardy and Ramanujan \cite{hardy1918} established the first asymptotic formula for $\partition{n}$, which was later refined by Rademacher \cite{rademacher1937} into an exact formula.

Despite these classical results, many questions about partition functions remain open, particularly regarding restricted partitions and error terms in asymptotic expansions. This paper presents three main contributions:

\begin{enumerate}
\item A refined error term in the Hardy-Ramanujan-Rademacher expansion
\item New asymptotic formulas for restricted partition functions
\item Applications to statistical physics models
\end{enumerate}

Our methods combine classical complex analysis techniques with modern developments in the theory of modular forms and circle methods.
